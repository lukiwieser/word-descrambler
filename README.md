# Word Descrambler

A small script to descramble a word whos letters were reordered randomly.

Example: **bsmlecra** => **scramble**

## Get started

This project requires [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to be installed on your machine.

First the project has to be downloaded. Then the required libraries can be installed by executing the following command in the project folder:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then the script can be executed with the following command:

```
python main.py -w bsmlecra
```

## Further Information

Currently only one input word is supported, so it is not possible to descramble whole sentences. There currently is also only support for the english language.

If you need more complex deciphers check out [Ciphey](https://github.com/Ciphey/Ciphey), their tool is really powerful.
